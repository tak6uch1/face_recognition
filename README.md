# OpenCV and Dlib Face Detection

Face detection is very common and works on many platforms such as Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, Jetson-nano, etc.
But when starting to build the environment following web sites, we often encounter some environmental problems.
I hope this repository helps someone who starts face recognition.
